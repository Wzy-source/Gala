# WaterToken
## Address

## Vulnerability Description
This contract has a vulnerability due to a misinterpreted constructor function. Although the function BliBliToken appears intended as the constructor, the correct constructor syntax in Solidity 0.4.12 is to use the contract’s name, WaterToken, as the constructor name. As a result, BliBliToken is treated as a regular function, not a constructor, which introduces a privilege escalation vulnerability.

To this end, critical variables such as `ethFundDeposit` can be controlled by attackers. Furthermore, the `isOwner` modifier relies on `ethFundDeposit` for ownership verification, which an attacker could exploit if they can call BliBliToken and set ethFundDeposit to their own address. This would allow the attacker to gain ownership privileges, bypassing the intended access control and potentially gaining unauthorized control over sensitive functions protected by isOwner.


## Vulnerability Code
```solidity
// contract WaterToken
function BliBliToken(
        address _ethFundDeposit,
        uint256 _currentSupply)
    {
        ethFundDeposit = _ethFundDeposit;

        isFunding = false;                           //通过控制预CrowdS ale状态
        fundingStartBlock = 0;
        fundingStopBlock = 0;

        currentSupply = formatDecimals(_currentSupply);
        totalSupply = formatDecimals(10000000);
        balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
        if(currentSupply > totalSupply) throw;
    }

    modifier isOwner()  { require(msg.sender == ethFundDeposit); _; }
```
